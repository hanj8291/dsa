Data structures & Algorithms Visualization Website
==================================================


* The user will be able to visualize various data structures and compare their time/space complexities through various search and sort algorithms
* The user can also select up to 3 different algorithms and compare their time/space complexity

**Search**

* Display a N x M grid 
* User selects point A and point B
* User can then choose whether or not to generate a maze on the grid
* Select a data structure and see a list of search algorithms that make use of it
* Select a search algorithm and see it go from point A to point B
* Display the time/space complexity and # of operations

**Sort**

* Display a bar graph going from 0 to N
* Select a data structure and see a list of sort algorithms that make use of it
* Select a sort algorithm and see it sort the bar graph
* Display the time/space complexity and # of operations

**Algorithm Design Patterns**

* User can select an algorithm design pattern and see a list of algorithms that make use of it
* Select an algorithm to visualize
* A problem that corresponds to that pattern is shown
* The user can first try to solve the problem themselves
* Then by clicking play, the problem is solved using the pattern
* Disply the time/space complexity and # of operations

**Mini-games**

* Simple games are able to be played single or multi player
* The game's bot is written using data structures and algorithms from the visualization component
* The bot's moves are visualized on the side

**Interview Questions**
* Displays interview questions that I coded out using different methods to compare the time/space complexity between them
